The insertion sort on a randomized array can take shortcuts when inputs are roughly in correct order. Therefore it takes longest on a reverse sorted array, quickest on a sorted array, and longest on a randomized array.

The selection sort is in the middle because it always runs in O(n^2) time regardless of if the array is sorted, reverse sorted, or randomized.

The merge sort on a randomized, sorted, and reverse sorted array are similar and only change depending on the amount of comparisons and swaps.
